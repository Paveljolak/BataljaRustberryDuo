DATE: 11/02/2024 - Created and submitted Player1.0. Tweeks of this bot are required.

WORK: Player1.0: We find the bigest enemy planet we divide it by 2. If our planets have larger fleets than that value then we attack with them. We attack enemy or neutral planet with smallest fleet size. 

PROBLEMS: How much troops to send. Where exactly to send them so our planets don't get obliterated. 
- How to calculate which of our planets should shoot, which one should rest and which one would require reinforcements.
Possible solution: - Have a global balance - all planets have same ammount of fleet size, and they balance each other.
                   - Have support/attacker bots. Where weaker supports stronger or stronger supports weaker and they alternate.

NEXT: Make another bot which will focus the closest planets. Find solution to the problems of the first bot.
